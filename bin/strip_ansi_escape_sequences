# Removes all ANSI escape sequences of the format "ESC[\d*\w". This is mainly
# useful for stripping out the color codes from strings.
# Note: This does not handle all ANSI escape sequences, as some do not fit the
# format specified above.

esc=""  # written elsewhere as \e or \033  # TODO: This is not copy-paste friendly. Esc char must be typed with Ctrl-V then ESC
